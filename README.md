# Sort Algorithm Visualiser (SAV)

## About
Sort Algorithm Visualiser (SAV) is a quick project I created whilst testing out SFML2. The purpose is to graphically represent different sorting algorithms.

## Note
This program is poorly designed. Multi-threading is poorly implemented and there are some parts in the code I am not happy with, however, I wanted to release this now as I never intended on working on it for long.
